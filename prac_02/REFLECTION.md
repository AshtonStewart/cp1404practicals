# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

100%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

Afternoons when I am capable. If I haven't been able to watch them all before friday afternoon, I finish watching them before starting other things.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Using loops and functions to ensure code only operates in ways I wish it to.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

It is extremely tempting to write codes and do things that could be considered shortcuts or simply use less lines at the cost of clarity. For example, codes that modify a user input I'm usually tempted to do all the math in the print but know it's less readable as a result.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I sometimes misread or misunderstand a task and either get into a position where I can't do something or struggle to complete all tasks due to a previous mistake. 

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

Implementing new content I learn along with pre-exisitng things. Making commit messages that I can easily follow and understanding how to reduce the amount of code I write so that each line has to do less without introducing new codes to make up for the reduction.
