## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

I was usually off by only 15-30 minutes each practical. As a percentage overall, I would say I was 75% to 90% accurate.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

I believe it got slightly more accurate towards the end. Smaller tasks I could usually predict how long they would take
with +- 5 minutes difference to how long they actually took while my estimate for longer projects stayed at the same
accuracy. 

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

The length of time required to complete most codes acts exponentially, with smaller additions quickly resulting in 
bigger and bigger demands for time as there is more room for error and it becomes easier to lose track of what does what
and overall, minor things that take near non-existant amounts of time in small code (regardless of what the action is)
begin to take large amounts of time in larger code.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Honestly I can't really think of much I have learned. Aside from a few minor things such as using something as a 
global constant or such, most of my code has remained the same. The biggest impact really would be checking my 
formatting and docstrings. 

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

The main thing that seperates people who are good at coding, and people who are great at coding doesn't necessarily come
down to the functionality of their code, but the quality of which they deliver. The most common mistakes I saw people 
making were small things I often also made which is just forgetting docstrings, comments, unnecessarily adding 
extra things that don't contribute enough to justify their existence, minor errors like that. 

It's helped me remind myself to triple check my working to avoid making those same mistakes over and over again which
has drastically improved the readability of the code I deliver.

### Good Code Review 1

[Review 1](https://github.com/Kanos812/cp1404practicals/pull/1)

### Explanation

You may have to take my word a bit here, but I was talking to this student and he explained to me that my feedback was 
extremely useful when writing assignment 1. Alot of my comments and recommendations (some admittedly now are not as 
good as I once thought due to improving my skills) I believe helped set up alot of good practices which he (hopefully)
implemeted in further projects.

### Good Code Review 2

[Review 2](https://github.com/Jordan-Whiteside/cp1404practicals/pull/5#event-15389975772)

### Explanation

In this one, the person replied so I know they took my advice and (hopefully) improved upon it. I believe the provided
feedback helped point out common, easy to make mistakes of theirs and also helped show them additional ways they could 
code features. I believe it also pointed out that it's easy to get into the habit of adding additional, unnecessary
features that while not detrimental to the code quality, ultimately distract from the focus of the code.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

While they did not take up excessive amounts of time, the code reviews overall did not feel very beneficial to me. 
Rarely did I recieve a request in time and often my the feedback I recieved did not really help me improve my code, 
it just pointed out minor errors. With that being said though, I do think it's a useful component, and the only way to 
have people take it more seriously would be to increase it's weighting in marking which I don't think is the right 
approach. 

Additionally, the marking seems a bit disproportionate in regards to a single error being worth 25%, just the same as 
core functionality of components missing. There have also been times where a mistake in one file has resulted in an 
extremely low mark across the entire practical which seems excessively harsh. 

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

Mainly code reviews. As far as I'm aware, I consistently got full marks, or near full marks for my code reviews.
