Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404
# REPO
This repository contains my practical 07 work. 

## Myself
I put alot into study but often start to poorly manage time hence why some of my work often looks rushed while others is extremely thorough.

- It's good to name variables using a similar method (though sometimes I feel like I have to break that pattern)
- Having code seperated into functions and such makes it much more readable and easy to understand. This is especially useful for debugging.
- Having code be compact isn't always good. Personally, I like to try and get as much accomplished in a single line but that often doesn't work and leads to issues.
